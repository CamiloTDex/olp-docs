# 5. Network Setup

All the following settings are recommended and can be left as they are:

* Network: Which network will your node use? (Default: GOERLI)
* Web3 provider: EVM compatible Web3 provider (Default: Infura)
* ChainID: Automatically chosen by the network
* Gas price: Gas price of your transactions.
* Minimum funds: The minimum amount of gas a user should have in its wallet to execute transactions. If the user has less, the node will automatically send gas to its account.
* Funding tokens: The amount of tokens that will be sent to a user that has less than minimum funds in its account.
