# Running the Installer

Before starting installation, ensure that you have at hand your api-key, as we are in beta phase, only the allowed keys will be able to install the node.

In order to install the node, execute the following commands:

```
npm i -g @olptools/cli
sudo olp-cli install <your-api-key>
```

It will output a set of URLs, go to the public URL of your server (typically the last one) in order to continue the process.
