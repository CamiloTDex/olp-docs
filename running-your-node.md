# Running Your OLP Node

⚠️ IF YOU INSTALLED THE OLP NODE AS A SERVICE IN LINUX, THE NODE SHOULD BE ALREADY WORKING AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARY

In order to run your OLP node, go to your installation folder and enter:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

The first time you run this command, it can take several minutes to install all the dependencies. Once it is running, a welcome message should appear indicating that the installation is successful.
