# About OLP Node

An OLP node connects to a private network consisting of other OLP nodes. This network is not connected to Ethereum Mainnet or an Ethereum testnet. 
Private networks typically use a different chain ID and consensus protocol. Participation in private networks is typically restricted in some way, so the volume of traffic is much lower than Mainnet, resulting in lower system requirements.
 
Private network system requirements depend on many factors, including:
Size of the world state for the network.
Number of transactions submitted to the network.
Block gas limit.
Number and complexity of JSON-RPC, PubSub, or GraphQL queries handled by the node.
