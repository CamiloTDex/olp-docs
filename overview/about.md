# About Open Logistics Protocol

Open Logistics Protocol (OLP or "Protocol") comprises a set of rules, standardized schemas, software libraries, blockchain nodes, and smart contracts that the logistics industry can use to improve transport of goods regionally as well as globally.

Logistics Networks mean groups of companies that have formed for specific purposes defined by the participating companies. These networks will use OLP as an “operating system” to standardize and streamline their operations. For example, companies that move hazardous material across jurisdictions may form a network to communicate with each other and use OLP’s smart contracts for workflow standardization.

OLP enables participants in the logistics industry to exchange information and value in a peer to peer environment while providing an unalterable and single and global source of truth about the transactions for all parties involved.

As Web3 protocol, the OLP is designed to leverage network effects while capturing value and distribute it equitably among its users, in a neural, cooperative style network, getting progressively decentralized as it grows.

## Mission and Objectives

The mission of the protocol is to provide a common and inclusive neutral platform for the logistics industry to increase efficiency and enable innovative business models. The objective of the protocol is to create a unified, open, trustworthy, and a common operating system. The protocol brings together the best of two worlds - the concept of decentralized networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and protocols to operate industry consortiums being developed by CBAN, MediLedger, openIDL, and MOBI.

The protocol cannot be as anonymous as Bitcoin or Ethereum due to the fact that logistics is a highly regulated industry with possibilities of fraud, claims at a massive scale. Some level of white listing and gatekeeping might be proven necessary. Such gatekeeping is performed by validator nodes (industry associations, government agencies, insurance providers, credit agencies, etc) using verifiable identities and off chain governance. At the same time, the protocol provides common services that can be consumed by network participants while processing and moving shipments.

## OLP is an Operating System for Logistics

OLP includes a set of functions which we call core services that the network participants utilize to build use cases on top. Industry and blockchain standards form the building blocks of the core services. Most importantly, these standards provide interoperability and ease of integration between disparate systems. Core services operate as an impartial provider of services to the participants as long as they adhere to the rules of the network. It is important that the core services are not owned, managed, or governed by a single person or entity.

The core services fulfill the following high level requirements. We expect these requirements to stay in place for a foreseeable future. However, these requirements can be modified and eased in the future when deemed necessary and approved by the governance token holders.
