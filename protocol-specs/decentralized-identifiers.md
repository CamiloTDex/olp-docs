# Decentralized Identifiers

All protocol resources are defined as decentralized ids. Each DID is represented in the following format:

**did:\<resource\_type>:\<resource\_location>\[@resourceId]**

This DID contains the required information to resolve a resource through the network.\
Examples of DID can be:

* did:node:0x388C818CA8B9251b393131C08a736A67ccB19297
* did:shipment:0x388C818CA8B9251b393131C08a736A67ccB19297@4ecbe7f9e8c1c9092c000027
* did:company:0x388C818CA8B9251b393131C08a736A67ccB19297@62b44ca73c5b3f0162267ea2

Each DID is unique and represents a single element in all the network.
